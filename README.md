# A overall goal of the project
In this project we intend to create a model that can distinguish whether the given picture contains a cat or a dog.
# B what framework are we going to use
we are going to use the pytorch image models as our framework as it is a collection of pre-trained image models that can be used for classification. We are going to use the framework to handle model training and evaluation
# C What data are you going to run on
We found a package of 30.000 150X150 grayscaled pictures of cats and dogs. We can use those pictures to train the model.

# D What models do you intend to use
We are going to some of the resnet models as they are widely used and highly reliable and they are good for smaller datasets.



# catdogdetection

ML learning to detect cats and dogs
